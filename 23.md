using a min-heap (or priority queue) is a more efficient approach for merging k sorted linked lists. 
This method leverages the properties of the min-heap to always pull the smallest current node from the k lists, ensuring that the merge process remains efficient.

    k is calculated as the size of the input lists plus one. This value is used to initialize the min-heap.
    A min-heap (priority queue) is initialized to store nodes based on their values. The compareBy function ensures that the nodes are ordered by their values.

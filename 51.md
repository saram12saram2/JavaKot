```
func solveNQueens(n int) [][]string {
    var results [][]string
    board := make([][]byte, n)
    for i := range board {
        board[i] = make([]byte, n)
        for j := range board[i] {
            board[i][j] = '.'
        }
    }
    backtrack(0, n, board, &results)
    return results
}
```

We define the solveNQueens function that takes an integer n (the size of the chessboard) and returns all distinct solutions as a slice of slices of strings.
results is a slice to store the solutions.
board is a 2D slice of bytes representing the chessboard, initialized with '.' (indicating empty spaces).
We call the backtrack function starting from row 0.
Backtracking:

```
func backtrack(row, n int, board [][]byte, results *[][]string) {
    if row == n {
        var solution []string
        for _, row := range board {
            solution = append(solution, string(row))
        }
        *results = append(*results, solution)
        return
    }

    for col := 0; col < n; col++ {
        if isValid(board, row, col, n) {
            board[row][col] = 'Q'
            backtrack(row+1, n, board, results)
            board[row][col] = '.'
        }
    }
}
```

The backtrack function attempts to place queens on the board, row by row.
If row equals n, it means we have successfully placed queens on all rows, so we create a solution from the current board and add it to results.
We iterate over each column in the current row to try placing a queen.
If placing a queen at (row, col) is valid (checked by the isValid function), we place the queen (board[row][col] = 'Q'), call backtrack for the next row (row+1), and then remove the queen (backtrack) to try the next column (board[row][col] = '.').
Validation:

```
func isValid(board [][]byte, row, col, n int) bool {
    for i := 0; i < row; i++ {
        if board[i][col] == 'Q' {
            return false
        }
    }

    for i, j := row-1, col-1; i >= 0 && j >= 0; i, j = i-1, j-1 {
        if board[i][j] == 'Q' {
            return false
        }
    }

    for i, j := row-1, col+1; i >= 0 && j < n; i, j = i-1, j+1 {
        if board[i][j] == 'Q' {
            return false
        }
    }

    return true
}
```

The isValid function checks if placing a queen at (row, col) is safe.
It checks the column above the current row to ensure no other queen is placed in the same column.
It checks the upper left diagonal to ensure no other queen is placed in the same diagonal.
It checks the upper right diagonal to ensure no other queen is placed in the same diagonal.
If all checks pass, it returns true, indicating it's safe to place the queen.
Iteration Example (n=4)
Let's see how it works for n=4:

Initial Board:


....
....
....
....
Placing the first queen at (0, 0):

Board state:

Q...
....
....
....
Call backtrack for the next row (row=1).
Row 1:

Try placing queen at (1, 0) -> Invalid (same column as (0, 0)).
Try placing queen at (1, 1) -> Invalid (diagonal with (0, 0)).
Try placing queen at (1, 2) -> Valid.
Board state:

Q...
..Q.
....
....
Call backtrack for the next row (row=2).
Row 2:

Try placing queen at (2, 0) -> Invalid (same column as (0, 0)).
Try placing queen at (2, 1) -> Invalid (diagonal with (1, 2)).
Try placing queen at (2, 2) -> Invalid (same column as (1, 2)).
Try placing queen at (2, 3) -> Valid.
Board state:

Q...
..Q.
....Q
....
Call backtrack for the next row (row=3).
Row 3:

Try placing queen at (3, 0) -> Invalid (same column as (0, 0)).
Try placing queen at (3, 1) -> Invalid (diagonal with (2, 3)).
Try placing queen at (3, 2) -> Valid.
Board state:

Q...
..Q.
....Q
.Q..
Found a valid solution, add it to results.
Backtrack:

Remove the queen from (3, 2), continue trying other columns in row 3.
No more valid positions in row 3, backtrack to row 2.
Remove the queen from (2, 3), continue trying other columns in row 2.
No more valid positions in row 2, backtrack to row 1.
Remove the queen from (1, 2), continue trying other columns in row 1.
Continue Searching:

This process continues, exploring all possible placements of queens and backtracking as needed, until all solutions are found.
By following this systematic approach, the backtracking algorithm ensures that all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle are found efficiently.
